/**
 * Derive a "reputation by source" view from the canonical balance breakdown.
 *
 * Oxy Trust weights reputation by HOW it was earned. The API returns a flat
 * per-category `breakdown`; Commons re-buckets it into the four civic sources a
 * citizen cares about, ordered strongest → weakest:
 *
 *   - `realLife`  (HIGH)    ← `physical`            — a counterpart scanned your
 *                                                     Oxy ID and signed for it
 *   - `peerCivic` (MEDIUM)  ← `trust`               — validated by a random jury
 *   - `apps`      (LOW)     ← `content` + `social`  — earned inside apps
 *   - `penalties` (PENALTY) ← `penalties`           — the absolute sum of debits
 *
 * This is a pure re-shaping of `ReputationBalance.breakdown` — the schema is NOT
 * changed (per the plan, the source split is derived client-side). The
 * authoritative lifetime total still comes from `ReputationBalance.total`, which
 * also folds in `moderation` (not surfaced as its own civic source in Fase 1).
